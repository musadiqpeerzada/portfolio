A curious software engineer who aims to learn, grow and contribute.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at [Refyne India](https://refyne.co.in/).

Prior to that, I was a Software Engineer at [FastHR.ai](https://www.curebase.com) where I contributed to the creation of certain HR Tech products like FastAssess (AI based Pre-screening tool) and FastEngage (Automated Hiring Workflow).

Before that, I worked at [OnlineSales.ai](https://www.onlinesales.ai/) and [SmartServ.io](https://zentrades.pro/) now ZenTrades, where I worked on CRM and added support for a new vertical (Fire Protection).

Outside of work, I watch football and sometimes write.
