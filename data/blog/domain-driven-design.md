Consider working on finance app where users can manage their investments. We get a list of features to develop and jump straight into implementation without fully understanding the complexities of the finance domain. The happy flows work fine but since we don't know much about the domain, we don't know all the scenarios that can arise. This leads to frequent errors and inaccurate data. Now we ask some friend with good knowledge of finance for help but although we know many computer languages, but we have no idea about the financial language. We will have a hard time communicating with our friend and he/she won't understand the code. Moreover there would be potential delays in project delivery, increased development costs due to rework, and even loss of customer trust if the application consistently delivers inaccurate financial data.
